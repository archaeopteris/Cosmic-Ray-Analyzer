# Cosmic-Ray-Analyzer
#Unfinished yet.
The Program analyzes data about intensity of cosmic rays, specifically muons. It should automatically determine peaks in intensity and prints them in seperate file with time points included.

#For now, it calculates derivatives for each point in time, prints them and stores in internal vector and peaks are well visible there. 

#Should add a threshold to filter out peaks from a vector containing derivatives of original data.
